# Data-Analyst-Project

This is my Project 04 for the data analyst bootcamp from university of toronto of continuing studies. 

My project topic is about cancer rates and analysing cancer reasearch in Ontario. 

The data used for this presentation: https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/data-research/view-data/cancer-statistics/ontario-cancer-profiles

Citation: Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario). Ontario Cancer Profiles [Internet]. 2023 [cited <date>]. Available from: https://cancercareontario.ca/ontariocancerprofiles

First I inported the excel files and transformed the excel files into csv's. The code is found on: Ontario_Cancer_Survival_Rate.ipynb
if needed further data trimming would have been done with sql under postgress (not needed)

Lastly take the newly created csv and create the visualizations using Microsoft's Power BI 

Here are the visuals for age, gender, and cancer type data collected in Ontario with a period of 5 years

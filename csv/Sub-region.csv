Notes:,"1.  Relative Survival Ratios (RSRs) are expressed as percentages; for cancers among all ages (15-99), RSRs are age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standards, which varies by cancer type. For more information see https://www.cancercareontario.ca/en/statistical-reports/ontario-cancer-statistics-2020/analysis#survival .",,,,,,,,
,"2.  Note, to be comparable with the sub-region level statistics, Ontario statistics exclude cancer cases of unknown residence (sub-region); therefore, provincial statistics may not match the true counts and rates published elsewhere ",,,,,,,,
,(Ontario Cancer Statistics report; Cancer Care Ontario’s website). ,,,,,,,,
,"3.  ""suppressed"" means the data are not shown due to imprecise survival estimates (i.e., RSR based on fewer than 10 cases or with a standard error of greater than or equal to 10%).",,,,,,,,
